# Å moodle Crawler

## Overview
This tool is designed for students to download and organize course content from Moodle for offline reading. It uses Python with Selenium to crawl through Moodle course sections, parts, and chapters, and compiles all the downloaded content into a single, easy-to-navigate HTML file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Chrome installed
- Chromedriver compatible with your Chrome version

### Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Setting Up the Environment
1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following structure:
```
DOMAIN=moodle.domain.cz
COURSE_ID=123456

```
2. Replace `your-moodlesession-cookie-value` with your Moodle session cookie (see below for details).

```
MOODLE_SESSION_COOKIE=your_cookie_value_here
```
